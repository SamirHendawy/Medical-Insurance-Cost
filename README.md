### Conclusion
- BMI : the distribution is normal distribution.
- From the describtion of data, the BMI range is 18.5 to 24.9
- There are a large number of people who are overweight.
- Most people in the data do not have children.
- There are outliers in the charges column.
- Most people's Insurance charges range from 1122 to 16600
- Distribute the regions in the data almost evenly.
- The insurance charges of smoker peoples is higher than non-smoker.
- The correlation pattern of people who smoke is different from that of non-smokers.
- The Southeast has the highest insurance charges, why ? -_- This may be due to an increase in the number of smokers or increased BMI levels.
- R-squared (R^2) For Testing Data Using Random Forest: 90.0 %
